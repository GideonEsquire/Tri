I'd love to be able to have this as a massively multiplayer game where
people work together to make shapes with their bodies.

### Possible Themes
* Exploration
* Reproduction (creating shapes with other shapes)
* Over population
* Isolation
* Family
* Races (Different color)
* Dark humor
* PVP / PVE elements
* Pick up projectiles
* One hit kills

### Look & Feel
* Similar to Diep.io
* Minimal
* Almost fish-like with rapid movement and snappy controls
* Dynamic soundscapes

### Possibilities
* Left mouse button is 'Love'. You can attach to another player
* Right mouse button is 'Rage'. You can shoot your projectile. If any
* You can stockpile projectiles
* Once three or more players are attached to eachother they can reproduce
* Reproduction has a long cool-down period. an hour or so...
* Maybe if while you are attached to another player and you pick up
    munitions everyone gets one. Some form of benefit for being together
* Purple glow for 'pure'. Red for 'rage'
* Polish to include tons of secrets, puzzles, Lore
* If a player chooses to be evil, music and sounds become more aggressive
    perhaps more chromatic notes. Clashing sounds. Uncomfortable atmosphere

### Environment
* Needs to have a lot of interest
* Players should be able to explore new things
* Able to spectate plays put on by NPCs
* Plethora of puzzles with loot as rewards
* PVE elements with traps and foes

### Mechanics
* Attach
* Attack

### Homage
* I want to reference a ton of things, unfortunately everything is non-verbal
    and with only simple shapes, this is going to be a challange

### Random things
* No need for food
* No need for health
* You die, you have to wait for an extended period before you can come back
    but you will be in an entirely different area
* Games within game: Mazes, jigsaw puzzles, checkers, chess, tic-tac-toe
* Need to have special barriers
