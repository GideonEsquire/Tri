I'd love to be able to have this as a massively multiplayer game where 
people work together to make shapes with their bodies.

### Possible Themes
* Exploration
* Reproduction (creating shapes with other shapes)
* Over population
* Isolation
* Family
* Races (Different color)
* Dark humor
* PVP / PVE elements
* Pick up projectiles
* One hit kills

### Look & Feel
* Similar to Diep.io
* Minimal

### Possibilities
* Left mouse button is 'Love'. You can attach to another player
* Right mouse button is 'Rage'. You can shoot your projectile. If any.
* You can stockpile projectiles.
* Once three or more players are attached to eachother they can reproduce.
* Reproduction has a long cool-down period. an hour or so...
* Maybe if while you are attached to another player and you pick up
    munitions everyone gets one. Some form of benefit for being together
* Purple glow for love. Red for rage.
